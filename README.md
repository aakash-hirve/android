# Project 1 - OTP Automator
This android application will take an HTTP(S) endpoint along with route (if any), then all incoming SMS messages will be sent to that endpoint. This was built for automating the OTP flow for COWIN, however this app can be used for multiple OTP automation usecases where SMS is involved.

## Usage
You can simply build this in Android Studio and install the APK.
